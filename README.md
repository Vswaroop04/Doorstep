# Doorstep

**Doorstep** is a web application designed to provide efficient solutions for daily requirements by connecting users with service providers such as plumbers, electricians, carpenters, tutors, and more. Our platform aims to streamline the process of finding and hiring professionals for various tasks, ensuring a hassle-free experience for users.

## Problem Statement

In many areas, there is a lack of centralized platforms where users can easily find and connect with various service providers. Doorstep addresses this issue by offering a comprehensive solution that not only connects users with service providers but also includes features for managing appointments and optimizing service routes.


## Features

- **Digital Scheduling**: Users can book appointments with service providers using a user-friendly online interface. Providers can manage these online bookings and arrange in-person appointments through their dedicated dashboard.

- **In-Person Appointments**: Schedule face-to-face meetings with service providers. Users can review and compare prices for in-person services to ensure they make well-informed choices.

- **Appointment Management**: Users can create both digital and in-person appointments with service providers. For in-person appointments, users have the ability to view and compare pricing options before finalizing their bookings.
